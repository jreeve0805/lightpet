# lightpet


The application runs on the arduino platform. The purpose of this app is to use a neopixel to represent events like an alarm clock. The idea came from those "wake up alarms" you see that are just lights that come on in the morning to wake you up during winter months. I adapted that idea, and placed a boarduino and a neopixel into a dollar store plastic toy. This toy sits in my childrens bedrooms, and changes colour througout the day. When its time to get ready for bed (story time) the lightpet changes to GREEN. When story time is over the pet changes PURPLE, aka "quite time". Finally the lightpet changes RED and the kids know its bedtime. In similar fashion the pet wakes up, and then gets the day started. It acts as artifical sun light in the dark winter months. 

For this software to funtion you need an arduino, a single neopixel, and a cheap transparent plastic toy from the dollar store. The source code might explain how to configure the neopixel. But I doubt it. This is my first open source project, and while I do have grandiose plans for this application, this software is not fit for any purpose. Feel free to put it on your arduino but expect catastrophic failure, even injury or death as a result.

Also, there are numerous code snips from Arduino projects found on the Adafruit web site, and Ardino.cc. Please accept this THANK YOU as recognition for the countless hours those two groups have put into their code, and as a result helped me with this project. My intention is to eventually replace that code with something I've written myself, but I will be forever greatful for getting me started.
